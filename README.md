## 🧭 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build an intelligent routing system that reduces emissions and improves fuel efficiency through real-time data ingestion, custom decision flows, and conversational AI agents.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time traffic, weather, and telematics integration
- Custom routing flows using Salesforce Flow Builder
- Natural language-based interactions via Agentforce
- CO₂ and fuel savings dashboards for environmental impact tracking

## 🧱 Unit 1: Preparation & Environment Setup

### ✅ Objective:
Create the foundational Salesforce environment.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. **Provision Org:**
   - Sign up for a **Salesforce Developer Org** with Agentforce, Data Cloud, and Experience Builder.
   - Confirm licenses and access rights.

2. **Assign Permissions:**
   - Apply relevant permission sets for Agentforce and Data Cloud.
   - Ensure Einstein Trust Layer is enabled for agent users.

3. **Initial Configuration:**
   - Enable **Data Cloud** via Setup → *Data Cloud Setup*.
   - Enable **Agentforce** via Setup → *Agents*.

4. **Tooling:**
   - Install **VS Code**, Salesforce CLI, Agentforce Developer Extension.
   - Familiarize yourself with **Flow Builder**, **Agent Builder**, and **Experience Builder**.

## 🔗 Unit 2: Data Integration Setup

### ✅ Objective:
Ingest live data for routing decisions.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. **Traffic & Weather:**
   - Identify third-party APIs.
   - Use **MuleSoft connectors** or **custom Apex callouts**.

2. **Telematics Data:**
   - Integrate vehicle data (location, fuel, ID).
   - Store in custom Salesforce objects.

3. **Data Configuration:**
   - Set up near-real-time ingestion frequency.
   - Automate refreshes and validate data formats.

---

## 📚 Unit 3: Knowledge Base & RAG Configuration

### ✅ Objective:
Power intelligent agent responses with best-practices knowledge.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Create a library in **Einstein Data Libraries**.
2. Upload at least 10 documents (PDFs, articles).
3. Enable **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
   - Index and vectorize content using Data Cloud.
   - Test with prompt queries.

---

## 🔁 Unit 4: Designing & Building Custom Flows

### ✅ Objective:
Build logic to calculate optimal delivery routes dynamically.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Define routing criteria (e.g., fuel, emissions).
2. Build **record-triggered or scheduled flows**.
3. Integrate decision logic and Apex actions.
4. Use **Flow Debugger** and **Plan Tracer** for testing.

---

## 🤖 Unit 5: Configuring Agentforce Actions & Topics

### ✅ Objective:
Link flows and knowledge to Agentforce actions.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Create an agent in **Agent Builder** (e.g., “Sustainable Logistics Advisor”).
2. Add topics like *Route Optimization*, *Eco-Driving Tips*.
3. Attach your flows and documents as topic actions.
4. Write clear **natural language instructions** and **guardrails**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Unit 6: Designing the Dispatcher UI with Experience Builder

### ✅ Objective:
Create an intuitive UI for dispatchers to interact with the agent.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Use **Experience Builder** to design a dashboard layout.
2. Embed:
   - **Agentforce chat/actions**
   - **Interactive maps**
   - **Search bars for NL queries**
3. Test various UI workflows for usability.

---

## 📈 Unit 7: Impact Metrics & Dashboard Integration

### ✅ Objective:
Visualize CO₂ savings, fuel reductions, and other KPIs.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Define metrics (CO₂, fuel, time).
2. Create **Formula Fields** and **Reports**.
3. Build real-time **Dashboards** (Salesforce or Tableau).
4. Tie dashboards to **flow outputs** for auto-updates.

---

## 🧪 Unit 8: Testing, Validation & Iteration

### ✅ Objective:
Ensure all system components work end-to-end.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Conduct **unit testing** (API, data, flow, UI).
2. Simulate real-world scenarios for **end-to-end testing**.
3. Run **User Acceptance Tests (UAT)** with dispatchers.
4. Iterate based on feedback.

---

## 🚀 Unit 9: Deployment, Documentation & Process Streamlining

### ✅ Objective:
Deploy to production and document the architecture.

### 🛠️ Steps:
1. Lock configurations, migrate to production.
2. Set up version control and backups.
3. Document:
   - System architecture
   - Flow logic
   - UI design
4. Record demo videos.
5. Automate where possible and plan for future data sources and flows.
